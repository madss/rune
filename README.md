# The áš±une Programming Language

Congratulations. You have just discovered the silly programming language called "rune". It is named after the fact that all lexical tokens consist of single characters (called "runes" in go). This decision makes it very easy to write a lexer for the language, and result in some fun restrictions for the design of the language. For example, the number `100` can only be written as e.g. `5*5*4`

## Installing

You can just do a `go build` to produce an executable.

## The language

In Rune everything is an expression. It supports `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`.

    >>> 1+2*3
    --> 7

assignment

    >>> a:1
    --> 1

sequences of expressions

    >>> a:1;b:2;a+b
    --> 3
